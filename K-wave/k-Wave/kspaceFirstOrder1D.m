%KSPACEFIRSTORDER1D     1D time-domain simulation of wave propagation.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       kspaceFirstOrder1D simulates the time-domain propagation of
%       compressional waves through a one-dimensional homogeneous or
%       heterogeneous acoustic medium given four input structures: kgrid,
%       medium, source, and sensor. The computation is based on a
%       first-order k-space model which accounts for power law absorption
%       and a heterogeneous sound speed and density. If medium.BonA is
%       specified, cumulative nonlinear effects are also modelled. At each
%       time-step (defined by kgrid.t_array), the acoustic field parameters
%       at the positions defined by sensor.mask are recorded and stored. If
%       kgrid.t_array is set to 'auto', this array is automatically
%       generated using makeTime. An anisotropic absorbing boundary layer
%       called a perfectly matched layer (PML) is implemented to prevent
%       waves that leave one side of the domain being reintroduced from the
%       opposite side (a consequence of using the FFT to compute the
%       spatial derivatives in the wave equation). This allows infinite
%       domain simulations to be computed using small computational grids.
%        
%       For a homogeneous medium the formulation is exact and the
%       time-steps are only limited by the effectiveness of the perfectly
%       matched layer. For a heterogeneous medium, the solution represents
%       a leap-frog pseudospectral method with a k-space correction that
%       improves the accuracy of computing the temporal derivatives. This
%       allows larger time-steps to be taken for the same level of accuracy
%       compared to conventional pseudospectral time-domain methods. The
%       computational grids are staggered both spatially and temporally.
%        
%       An initial pressure distribution can be specified by assigning a
%       matrix (the same size as the computational grid) of arbitrary
%       numeric values to source.p0. A time varying pressure source can
%       similarly be specified by assigning a binary matrix (i.e., a matrix
%       of 1's and 0's with the same dimensions as the computational grid)
%       to source.p_mask where the 1's represent the grid points that form
%       part of the source. The time varying input signals are then
%       assigned to source.p. This can be a single time series (in which
%       case it is applied to all source elements), or a matrix of time
%       series following the source elements using MATLAB's standard
%       column-wise linear matrix index ordering. A time varying velocity
%       source can be specified in an analogous fashion, where the source
%       location is specified by source.u_mask, and the time varying input
%       velocity is assigned to source.ux.             
%
%       The field values are returned as arrays of time series at the
%       sensor locations defined by sensor.mask. This can be defined in
%       three different ways. (1) As a binary matrix (i.e., a matrix of 1's
%       and 0's with the same dimensions as the computational grid)
%       representing the grid points within the computational grid that
%       will collect the data. (2) As the grid coordinates of two opposing
%       ends of a line in the form [x1; x2]. This is equivalent to using a
%       binary sensor mask covering the same region, however, the output is
%       indexed differently as discussed below. (3) As a series of
%       Cartesian coordinates within the grid which specify the location of
%       the pressure values stored at each time step. If the Cartesian
%       coordinates don't exactly match the coordinates of a grid point,
%       the output values are calculated via interpolation. The Cartesian
%       points must be given as a 1 by N matrix corresponding to the x
%       positions, where the Cartesian origin is assumed to be in the
%       center of the grid. If no output is required, the sensor input can
%       be replaced with an empty array [].                 
%
%       If sensor.mask is given as a set of Cartesian coordinates, the
%       computed sensor_data is returned in the same order. If sensor.mask
%       is given as a binary matrix, sensor_data is returned using MATLAB's
%       standard column-wise linear matrix index ordering. In both cases,
%       the recorded data is indexed as sensor_data(sensor_point_index,
%       time_index). For a binary sensor mask, the field values at a
%       particular time can be restored to the sensor positions within the
%       computation grid using unmaskSensorData. If sensor.mask is given as
%       a list of opposing ends of a line, the recorded data is indexed as
%       sensor_data(line_index).p(x_index, time_index), where x_index
%       corresponds to the grid index within the line, and line_index
%       corresponds to the number of lines if more than one is specified.
%        
%       By default, the recorded acoustic pressure field is passed directly
%       to the output sensor_data. However, other acoustic parameters can
%       also be recorded by setting sensor.record to a cell array of the
%       form {'p', 'u', 'p_max', ...}. For example, both the particle
%       velocity and the acoustic pressure can be returned by setting
%       sensor.record = {'p', 'u'}. If sensor.record is given, the output
%       sensor_data is returned as a structure with the different outputs
%       appended as structure fields. For example, if sensor.record = {'p',
%       'p_final', 'p_max', 'u'}, the output would contain fields
%       sensor_data.p, sensor_data.p_final, sensor_data.p_max, and
%       sensor_data.ux. Most of the output parameters are recorded at the
%       given sensor positions and are indexed as
%       sensor_data.field(sensor_point_index, time_index) or
%       sensor_data(line_index).field(x_index, time_index) if using a
%       sensor mask defined as opposing ends of a line. The exceptions are
%       the averaged quantities ('p_max', 'p_rms', 'u_max', 'p_rms',
%       'I_avg'), the 'all' quantities ('p_max_all', 'p_min_all',
%       'u_max_all', 'u_min_all'), and the final quantities ('p_final',
%       'u_final'). The averaged quantities are indexed as
%       sensor_data.p_max(sensor_point_index) or
%       sensor_data(line_index).p_max(x_index) if using line ends, while
%       the final and 'all' quantities are returned over the entire grid
%       and are always indexed as sensor_data.p_final(n), regardless of the
%       type of sensor mask.                        
%
%       kspaceFirstOrder1D may also be used for time reversal image
%       reconstruction by assigning the time varying pressure recorded over
%       an arbitrary sensor surface to the input field
%       sensor.time_reversal_boundary_data. This data is then enforced in
%       time reversed order as a time varying Dirichlet boundary condition
%       over the sensor surface given by sensor.mask. The boundary data
%       must be indexed as
%       sensor.time_reversal_boundary_data(sensor_point_index, time_index).
%       If sensor.mask is given as a set of Cartesian coordinates, the
%       boundary data must be given in the same order. An equivalent binary
%       sensor mask (computed using nearest neighbour interpolation) is
%       then used to place the pressure values into the computational grid
%       at each time step. If sensor.mask is given as a binary matrix of
%       sensor points, the boundary data must be ordered using MATLAB's
%       standard column-wise linear matrix indexing. If no additional
%       inputs are required, the source input can be replaced with an empty
%       array [].                
%
%       Acoustic attenuation compensation can also be included during time
%       reversal image reconstruction by assigning the absorption
%       parameters medium.alpha_coeff and medium.alpha_power and reversing
%       the sign of the absorption term by setting medium.alpha_sign = [-1,
%       1]. This forces the propagating waves to grow according to the
%       absorption parameters instead of decay. The reconstruction should
%       then be regularised by assigning a filter to medium.alpha_filter
%       (this can be created using getAlphaFilter).         
%
%       Note: To run a simple photoacoustic image reconstruction example
%       using time reversal (that commits the 'inverse crime' of using the
%       same numerical parameters and model for data simulation and image
%       reconstruction), the sensor_data returned from a k-Wave simulation
%       can be passed directly to sensor.time_reversal_boundary_data with
%       the input fields source.p0 and source.p removed or set to zero.

% Note: For heterogeneous medium parameters, medium.sound_speed and

%
%       'CartInterp'- Interpolation mode used to extract the pressure when

%                     and more than one Cartesian point maps to the same

%                     sensor_data will be returned with less points than
%                     that specified by sensor.mask.
%       'CreateLog' - Boolean controlling whether the command line output
%                     is saved using the diary function with a date and
%                     time stamped filename (default = false). 
%       'DataCast'  - String input of the data type that variables are cast
%                     to before computation. For example, setting to
%                     'single' will speed up the computation time (due to
%                     the improved efficiency of fftn and ifftn for this
%                     data type) at the expense of a loss in precision.
%                     This variable is also useful for utilising GPU
%                     parallelisation through libraries such as the
%                     Parallel Computing Toolbox by setting 'DataCast' to

%       'DataRecast'- Boolean controlling whether the output data is cast
%                     back to double precision. If set to false,
%                     sensor_data will be returned in the data format set
%                     using the 'DataCast' option.
%       'DisplayMask' - Binary matrix overlayed onto the animated

%                     (default = sensor.mask).
%       'LogScale'  - Boolean controlling whether the pressure field is log
%                     compressed before display (default = false). The data
%                     is compressed by scaling both the positive and
%                     negative values between 0 and 1 (truncating the data
%                     to the given plot scale), adding a scalar value
%                     (compression factor) and then using the corresponding
%                     portion of a log10 plot for the compression (the
%                     negative parts are remapped to be negative thus the
%                     default color scale will appear unchanged). The
%                     amount of compression can be controlled by adjusting
%                     the compression factor which can be given in place of
%                     the Boolean input. The closer the compression factor
%                     is to zero, the steeper the corresponding part of the
%                     log10 plot used, and the greater the compression (the
%                     default compression factor is 0.02).
%       'MovieArgs' - Settings for movie2avi. Parameters must be given as
%                     {param, value, ...} pairs within a cell array
%                     (default = {}).
%       'MovieName' - Name of the movie produced when 'RecordMovie' is set
%                     to true (default = 'date-time-kspaceFirstOrder2D').
%       'PlotFreq'  - The number of iterations which must pass before the
%                     simulation plot is updated (default = 10).
%       'PlotLayout'- Boolean controlling whether a four panel plot of the
%                     initial simulation layout is produced (initial
%                     pressure, sensor mask, sound speed, density)
%                     (default = false).
%       'PlotPML'   - Boolean controlling whether the perfectly matched
%                     layer is shown in the simulation plots. If set to
%                     false, the PML is not displayed (default = true).
%       'PlotScale' - [min, max] values used to control the scaling for
%                     imagesc (visualisation). If set to 'auto', a
%                     symmetric plot scale is chosen automatically for each
%                     plot frame.
%       'PlotSim'   - Boolean controlling whether the simulation iterations
%                     are progressively plotted (default = true).
%       'PMLAlpha'  - Absorption within the perfectly matched layer in
