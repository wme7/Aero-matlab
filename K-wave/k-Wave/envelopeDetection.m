function env = envelopeDetection(x)
%ENVELOPEDETECTION  Extract signal envelope using the Hilbert Transform.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       envelopeDetection applies the Hilbert transform to extract the
%       envelope from an input vector x. If x is a matrix, the envelope
%       along each row is returned.
%
%       Example:
%           x = toneBurst(10e6, 0.5e6, 10);
%           plot(0:length(x)-1, x, 'k-', 0:length(x)-1, envelopeDetection(x), 'r-');
%           legend('Input Signal', 'Envelope');
%
% USAGE:
%       env = envelopeDetection(x)
%
% INPUTS:
%       x           - input function
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       env         - envelope of input function
