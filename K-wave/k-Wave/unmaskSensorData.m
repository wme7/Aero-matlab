function unmasked_sensor_data = unmaskSensorData(kgrid, sensor, sensor_data)
%UNMASKSENSORDATA   Reorder data recorded using a binary sensor mask.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       unmaskSensorData restores the grid position of the data recorded at
%       a single time-step within the time-series data returned by
%       kspaceFirstOrder1D, kspaceFirstOrder2D, or kspaceFirstOrder3D when
%       using a binary sensor mask.
%
% USAGE:
%       unmasked_sensor_data = unmaskSensorData(kgrid, sensor, sensor_data)
%
% INPUTS:
%       kgrid       - k-Wave grid structure returned by makeGrid
%       sensor      - k-Wave sensor structure where sensor.mask is defined
%                     as binary grid 
%       sensor_data - sensor data (returned by the first order simulation
%                     functions) at a single time-step ordered using
%                     MATLAB's standard column-wise linear matrix indexing 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       unmasked_sensor_data - Grid with the sensor data reordered to its
%                              original position on the sensor mask
