function alpha = neper2db(alpha, y)
%NEPER2DB   Convert nepers to decibels.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       neper2db converts an attenuation coefficient in units of
%       Nepers/((rad/s)^y m)to units of dB/(MHz^y cm).
%
% USAGE:
%       alpha = neper2db(alpha)
%       alpha = neper2db(alpha, y)
%
% INPUTS:
%       alpha       - attenuation in Nepers/((rad/s)^y m)
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       y           - power law exponent (default = 1)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       alpha       - attenuation in dB/(MHz^y cm)
