function att = attenuationWater(f, T)
%ATTENUATIONWATER Calculate ultrasound attenuation in distilled water.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       attenuationWater calculates the ultrasonic absorption in distilled
%       water at a given temperature and frequency using a 7th order
%       polynomial fitted to the data given by Pinkerton (1949). 
%
% USAGE:
%       att = attenuationWater(f, T)
%
% INPUTS:
%       f   - array of frequency values [MHz]
%       T   - water temperature [degC]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       att - attenuation [dB/cm]
