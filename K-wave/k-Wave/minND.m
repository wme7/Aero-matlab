function [min_val, ind] = minND(mat)
%MAXND   Return the value and indices of the smallest value in an N-D array.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       minND returns the smallest value in the N-D array given by mat. The
%       indices of the smallest value within the array can also be
%       returned, where ind = [ind_dim_1, ind_dim_2, ... , ind_dim_N]. The
%       indices can be used to directly address the smallest value, i.e.,
%       min_val = mat(ind).
%
% USAGE:
%       min_val = minND(mat)
%       [min_val, ind] = minND(mat)
%
% INPUTS:
%       mat             - input array
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       min_val         - smallest value in mat
%       ind             - array of indices corresponding to the location of
%                         the smallest value in mat
