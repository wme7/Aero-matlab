function [signal, snr] = addNoise(signal, snr, mode)
%ADDNOISE   Add Gaussian noise to a signal for a given SNR.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       addNoise adds Gaussian random noise to a one dimensional input
%       signal given the desired signal snr (signal to noise ratio)
%       in decibels. By default, the magnitude of the added noise is
%       calculated based on the rms level of the input signal. For
%       impulsive signals, the optional input mode should be set to 'peak'
%       so the magnitude of the added noise is calculated based on the peak
%       level of the input signal.
%
% USAGE:
%       signal = addNoise(signal, snr)
%       signal = addNoise(signal, snr, mode)
%       [signal, snr] = addNoise(signal, snr)
%       [signal, snr] = addNoise(signal, snr, mode)
%
% INPUTS:
%       signal      - input signal
%       snr         - desired signal snr (signal to noise ratio)
%                     in decibels after adding noise 
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       mode        - 'rms' (default) or 'peak'
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       signal      - signal with added noise
%       snr         - actual snr of output signal
