function signal = logCompression(signal, a, normalise)
%LOGCOMPRESSION   Log compress an input signal.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       logCompression compresses the input signal using the expression
%       signal = log10(1 + a*signal)./log10(1 + a) 
%
% USAGE:
%       signal = logCompression(signal, a)
%       signal = logCompression(signal, a, normalise)
%
% INPUTS:
%       signal      - input signal
%       a           - compression factor
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS
%       normalise   - Boolean controlling whether the maximum of the input
%                     signal is normalised to unity before compression
%                     (default = false). If set to true, the original
%                     magnitude is restored after compression.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       signal      - log compressed signal
