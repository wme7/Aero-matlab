function checkFactors(min_number, max_number)
%CHECKFACTORS   Return the maximum prime factor for a range of numbers.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       checkFactors loops through the given range of numbers and finds the
%       numbers with the smallest maximum prime factors. This allows
%       suitable grid sizes to be selected to maximise the speed of the FFT
%       (this is fastest for FFT lengths with small prime factors).
%    
% USAGE:
%       checkFactors(min_number, max_number)
