function signal = gaussianFilter(signal, Fs, freq, bandwidth, plot_filter)
%GAUSSIANFILTER   Filter signals using a frequency domain Gaussian filter.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       gaussianFilter applies a frequency domain Gaussian filter with the
%       specified center frequency and percentage bandwidth to the input
%       signal. If the input signal is given as a matrix, the filter is
%       applied to each matrix row. 
%
% USAGE:
%       signal = gaussianFilter(signal, Fs, freq, bandwidth)
%       signal = gaussianFilter(signal, Fs, freq, bandwidth, plot_filter)
%
% INPUTS:
%       signal      - signal/s to filter
%       Fs          - sampling frequency [Hz]
%       freq        - filter center frequency [Hz]
%       bandwidth   - filter bandwidth [%]
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       plot_filter - Boolean controlling whether the filtering process is
%                     plotted
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       signal      - filtered signal/s
