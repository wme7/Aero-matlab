function mat3D = revolve2D(mat2D)
%REVOLVE2D   Form 3D matrix from revolution of 2D matrix.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       revolve2D revolves the values of a 2D matrix about the x axis (or
%       matrix rows) to form a 3D matrix. A single point is taken as the
%       x-axis origin, thus for an input matrix of size m by n, the output
%       matrix will be m by (2n-1) by (2n-1). Values outside the
%       interpolation range are set to zero.
%
% USAGE:
%       mat3D = revolve2D(mat2D)
%
% INPUTS:
%       mat2D       - 2D input matrix
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       mat3D       - 3D output matrix
