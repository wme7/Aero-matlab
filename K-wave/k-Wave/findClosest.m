function [value, index] = findClosest(A, a)
%FINDCLOSEST    Return the closest value in a matrix.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       findClosest returns the value and index of the item in A that is
%       closest to the value a. For vectors, value and index correspond to
%       the closest element in A. For matrices, value and index are row
%       vectors corresponding to the closest element from each column. For
%       N-D arrays, the function finds the closest value along the first
%       non-singleton dimension. If there is more than one element with the
%       closest value, the index of the first one is returned.
%
% USAGE:
%       value = findClosest(A, a)
%       [value, index] = findClosest(A, a)
%
% INPUTS:
%       A               - matrix to search
%       a               - value to find
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       value           - value in A that is closest to a
%       index           - the index of a within A
