function bitmask = bool2bitmask(boolean_array)
%BOOL2BITMASK     Convert boolean values to a 64-bit bitmask
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       bool2bitmask takes an input array of boolean values, and returns a
%       64-bit bitmask.
%
% USAGE:
%       bitmask = bool2bitmask(boolean_array)
%
% INPUTS:
%       boolean_array   - input array
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       bitmask         - output bitmask
