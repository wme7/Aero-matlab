function [tri, bc] = gridDataFast2D_tsearch(x, y, xi, yi)
% DESCRIPTION:
%       Stripped down version of GRIDDATA that removes inbuilt data
%       checking and allows input and output of the delaunay triangulation
%       for use on subsequent calls with the exact same set of data
%       coordinates 
%
% USAGE:
%       [tri, bc] = gridDataFast(x, y, xi, yi)
%
% INPUT/OUTPUT
%       x, y, xi, yi, are the same as griddata
