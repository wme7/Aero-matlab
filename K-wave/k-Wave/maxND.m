function [max_val, ind] = maxND(mat)
%MAXND   Return the value and indices of the largest value in an N-D array.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       maxND returns the largest value in the N-D array given by mat. The
%       indices of the largest value within the array can also be returned,
%       where ind = [ind_dim_1, ind_dim_2, ... , ind_dim_N]. The indices
%       can be used to directly address the largest value, i.e., max_val =
%       mat(ind).
%
% USAGE:
%       max_val = maxND(mat)
%       [max_val, ind] = maxND(mat)
%
% INPUTS:
%       mat             - input array
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       max_val         - largest value in mat
%       ind             - array of indices corresponding to the location of
%                         the largest value in mat
