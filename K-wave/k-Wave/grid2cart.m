function [cart_data, order_index] = grid2cart(kgrid, grid_data)
%GRID2CART Return the Cartesian coordinates of the non-zero points of a binary grid.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       grid2cart returns the set of Cartesian coordinates corresponding to
%       the non-zero elements in the binary matrix grid_data, in the
%       coordinate framework defined in kgrid.
%
% USAGE:
%       [cart_data, order_index] = grid2cart(kgrid, grid_data)
%
% INPUTS:
%       kgrid       - k-Wave grid structure returned by makeGrid
%       grid_data   - binary grid with the same dimensions as the k-Wave
%                     grid structure kgrid 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       cart_data   - 1 x N, 2 x N, or 3 x N (for 1, 2, and 3
%                     dimensions) array of Cartesian sensor points
%       order_index - the order that the Cartesian points appear in
%                     grid_data according to MATLAB's standard column-wise
%                     linear matrix index ordering
