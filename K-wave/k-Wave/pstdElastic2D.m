%PSTDELASTIC2D      2D time-domain simulation of elastic wave propagation
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       pstdElastic2D simulates the time-domain propagation of elastic
%       waves through a two-dimensional homogeneous or heterogeneous medium
%       given four input structures: kgrid, medium, source, and sensor. The
%       computation is based on a pseudospectral time domain model which
%       accounts for viscoelastic absorption and heterogeneous material
%       parameters. At each time-step (defined by kgrid.t_array), the
%       wavefield parameters at the positions defined by sensor.mask are
%       recorded and stored. If kgrid.t_array is set to 'auto', this array
%       is automatically generated using makeTime. An anisotropic absorbing
%       boundary layer called a perfectly matched layer (PML) is
%       implemented to prevent waves that leave one side of the domain
%       being reintroduced from the opposite side (a consequence of using
%       the FFT to compute the spatial derivatives in the wave equation).
%       This allows infinite domain simulations to be computed using small
%       computational grids.   
%
%       An initial pressure distribution can be specified by assigning a
%       matrix of pressure values the same size as the computational grid
%       to source.p0. This is then assigned to the normal components of the
%       stress within the simulation function. A time varying stress source
%       can similarly be specified by assigning a binary matrix (i.e., a
%       matrix of 1's and 0's with the same dimensions as the computational
%       grid) to source.s_mask where the 1's represent the grid points that
%       form part of the source. The time varying input signals are then
%       assigned to source.sxx, source.syy, and source.sxy. These can be a
%       single time series (in which case it is applied to all source
%       elements), or a matrix of time series following the source elements
%       using MATLAB's standard column-wise linear matrix index ordering. A
%       time varying velocity source can be specified in an analogous
%       fashion, where the source location is specified by source.u_mask,
%       and the time varying input velocity is assigned to source.ux and
%       source.uy.   
%
%       The field values are returned as arrays of time series at the
%       sensor locations defined by sensor.mask. This can be defined in
%       three different ways. (1) As a binary matrix (i.e., a matrix of 1's
%       and 0's with the same dimensions as the computational grid)
%       representing the grid points within the computational grid that
%       will collect the data. (2) As the grid coordinates of two opposing
%       corners of a rectangle in the form [x1; y1; x2; y2]. This is
%       equivalent to using a binary sensor mask covering the same region,
%       however, the output is indexed differently as discussed below. (3)
%       As a series of Cartesian coordinates within the grid which specify
%       the location of the pressure values stored at each time step. If
%       the Cartesian coordinates don't exactly match the coordinates of a
%       grid point, the output values are calculated via interpolation. The
%       Cartesian points must be given as a 2 by N matrix corresponding to
%       the x and y positions, respectively, where the Cartesian origin is
%       assumed to be in the center of the grid. If no output is required,
%       the sensor input can be replaced with an empty array [].     
%
%       If sensor.mask is given as a set of Cartesian coordinates, the
%       computed sensor_data is returned in the same order. If sensor.mask
%       is given as a binary matrix, sensor_data is returned using MATLAB's
%       standard column-wise linear matrix index ordering. In both cases,
%       the recorded data is indexed as sensor_data(sensor_point_index,
%       time_index). For a binary sensor mask, the field values at a
%       particular time can be restored to the sensor positions within the
%       computation grid using unmaskSensorData. If sensor.mask is given as
%       a list of opposing corners of a rectangle, the recorded data is
%       indexed as sensor_data(rect_index).p(x_index, y_index, time_index),
%       where x_index and y_index correspond to the grid index within the
%       rectangle, and rect_index corresponds to the number of rectangles
%       if more than one is specified.    
%
%       By default, the recorded acoustic pressure field is passed directly
%       to the output sensor_data. However, other acoustic parameters can
%       also be recorded by setting sensor.record to a cell array of the
%       form {'p', 'u', 'p_max', ...}. For example, both the particle
%       velocity and the acoustic pressure can be returned by setting
%       sensor.record = {'p', 'u'}. If sensor.record is given, the output
%       sensor_data is returned as a structure with the different outputs
%       appended as structure fields. For example, if sensor.record = {'p',
%       'p_final', 'p_max', 'u'}, the output would contain fields
%       sensor_data.p, sensor_data.p_final, sensor_data.p_max,
%       sensor_data.ux, and sensor_data.uy. Most of the output parameters
%       are recorded at the given sensor positions and are indexed as
%       sensor_data.field(sensor_point_index, time_index) or
%       sensor_data(rect_index).field(x_index, y_index, time_index) if
%       using a sensor mask defined as opposing rectangular corners. The
%       exceptions are the averaged quantities ('p_max', 'p_rms', 'u_max',
%       'p_rms', 'I_avg'), the 'all' quantities ('p_max_all', 'p_min_all',
%       'u_max_all', 'u_min_all'), and the final quantities ('p_final',
%       'u_final'). The averaged quantities are indexed as
%       sensor_data.p_max(sensor_point_index) or
%       sensor_data(rect_index).p_max(x_index, y_index) if using
%       rectangular corners, while the final and 'all' quantities are
%       returned over the entire grid and are always indexed as
%       sensor_data.p_final(nx, ny), regardless of the type of sensor mask.
%       
%       pstdElastic2D may also be used for time reversal image
%       reconstruction by assigning the time varying pressure recorded over
%       an arbitrary sensor surface to the input field
%       sensor.time_reversal_boundary_data. This data is then enforced in
%       time reversed order as a time varying Dirichlet boundary condition
%       over the sensor surface given by sensor.mask. The boundary data
%       must be indexed as
%       sensor.time_reversal_boundary_data(sensor_point_index, time_index).
%       If sensor.mask is given as a set of Cartesian coordinates, the
%       boundary data must be given in the same order. An equivalent binary
%       sensor mask (computed using nearest neighbour interpolation) is
%       then used to place the pressure values into the computational grid
%       at each time step. If sensor.mask is given as a binary matrix of
%       sensor points, the boundary data must be ordered using MATLAB's
%       standard column-wise linear matrix indexing. If no additional
%       inputs are required, the source input can be replaced with an empty
%       array [].
