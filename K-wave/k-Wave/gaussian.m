function gauss_distr = gaussian(x, magnitude, mean, variance)
%GAUSSIAN   Create a Gaussian distribution.
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%       gaussian returns a Gaussian distribution f(x) with the specified
%       magnitude, mean, and variance. If these values are not specified,
%       the magnitude is normalised and values of variance = 1 and mean = 0
%       are used. For example running
%           x = -3:0.05:3;
%           plot(x, gaussian(x));
%       will plot a normalised Gaussian distribution.
%
%       Note, the full width at half maximum of the resulting distribution
%       can be calculated by FWHM = 2 * sqrt(2 * log(2) * variance).
%
% USAGE:
%       gauss_distr = gaussian(x)
%       gauss_distr = gaussian(x, magnitude)
%       gauss_distr = gaussian(x, magnitude, mean)
%       gauss_distr = gaussian(x, magnitude, mean, variance)
%
% INPUTS:
%       x           - x-axis variable
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       magnitude   - bell height (default = normalised)
%       mean        - mean or expected value (default = 0)
%       variance    - variance ~ bell width (default = 1)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       gauss_distr - Gaussian distribution
