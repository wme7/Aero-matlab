function points = getSpacedPoints(X1, X2, N, spacing)
%GETSPACEDPOINTS     Create vector of log or linear spaced points.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       getSpacedPoints generates a row vector of either logarithmically
%       or linearly spaced points between X1 and X2. When spacing is set to
%       'linear', the function is identical to the inbuilt linspace
%       function. When spacing is set to 'log', the function is similar to
%       the inbuilt logspace function, except that X1 and X2 define the
%       start and end numbers, not decades. For logarithmically spaced
%       points, X1 must be > 0. If N < 2, X2 is returned. 
%
% USAGE:
%       points = getSpacedPoints(X1, X2)
%       points = getSpacedPoints(X1, X2, N)
%       points = getSpacedPoints(X1, X2, N, spacing)
%
% INPUTS:
%       X1          - starting points value
%       X2          - ending points value (where X2 > X1)
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       N           - number of points in the vector (default = 100)
%       spacing     - 'log' or 'linear' spaced values (default = 'linear')
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       points      - row vector of equally spaced points
