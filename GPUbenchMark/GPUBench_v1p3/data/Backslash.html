    These results show the performance of the GPU when calculating the 
    <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/mldivide.html">matrix left division</a>
    of an <code>NxN</code> matrix with an <code>Nx1</code> vector. The number of operations
    is assumed to be <code>2/3*N^3 + 3/2*N^2</code>.

    This calculation is usually compute-bound, i.e. the performance depends
    mainly on how fast the GPU can perform floating-point operations.
