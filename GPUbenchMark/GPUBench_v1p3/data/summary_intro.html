    The table and chart below show the peak performance of various GPUs
    using the same MATLAB version. Your results (if any) are highlighted in
    bold in the table and on the chart. All other results are from
    pre-stored data. The peak performance shown is usually achieved when 
    dealing with extremely large arrays. Typical performance in day-to-day
    use will usually be much lower.

    Since MATLAB works mostly in double precision the devices are ranked
    according to how well they perform double-precision calculations. Single
    precision results are included for completeness. For all results, 
    higher is better.
